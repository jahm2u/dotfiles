   - After presenting the issue content, ask the user:
     "Would you like me to create this issue on GitHub? Please review the content above and confirm."
   - Wait for explicit approval before proceeding to create the issue
   - If changes are requested, update the issue content and present it again

   **ðŸ¤– AI Tool Recommendations:**
   - Use **consensus** for final validation before submission:
     ```
     Get a consensus with o3 being supportive and gemini pro being critical to 
     review this GitHub issue content for completeness and clarity before submission

     ```
     Use codereview to perform a final quality check of the GitHub issue content, 
     ensuring it meets professional standards and project requirements
     ```

6. Create the Issue on GitHub (After Approval)
   - First, save the issue content to a file:
     ```bash
     # Save the issue content to a markdown file
     # This helps preserve formatting and allows for review
     ```
   - Check GitHub CLI authentication:
     ```bash
     gh auth status
     ```
   - If not authenticated or wrong account, authenticate:
     ```bash
     gh auth login
     ```
   - Create the issue using GitHub CLI:
     ```bash
     # Basic command structure:
     gh issue create --repo [owner/repo] --title "[Title]" --body-file [filename.md] --label [label]
     
     # If labels don't exist, use only standard labels like 'enhancement' or 'bug'
     # Check available labels first with: gh label list --repo [owner/repo]
     ```
   - If the repository uses SSH aliases (like tp:owner/repo), add a standard GitHub remote first:
     ```bash
     git remote add github https://github.com/[owner]/[repo].git
     ```
   - After successful creation, provide the issue URL to the user and delete the file.

   **ðŸ¤– AI Tool Recommendations:**
   - Use **precommit** style validation for final checks:
     ```
     Use precommit-style validation to ensure the GitHub issue meets all 
     requirements before creation and submission
     ```
   - Use **debug** if issue creation encounters problems:
     ```
     If GitHub issue creation fails, use debug with gemini pro to systematically 
     investigate authentication, permissions, or CLI configuration issues
     ```
